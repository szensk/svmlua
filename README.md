After watching Terrence Parr's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjaAToVkoTw&feature=youtu.be) on a [simple virtual machine](https://github.com/parrt/simple-virtual-machine/), I decided to implement it. I happen to like Lua the most and so I used to Lua. It's about 4x slower than the Java version, which isn't horrible for a dynamic language. Just run `luajit test.lua` to see it in action.
